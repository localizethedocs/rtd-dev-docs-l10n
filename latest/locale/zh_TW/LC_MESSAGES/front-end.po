"Previously, JavaScript development has been done in monolithic files or "

"Modularizing code with `Browserify`_ is a good first step. In this "
"development workflow, major dependencies commonly used across JavaScript "
"includes are installed with `Bower`_ for testing, and vendorized as "
"standalone libraries via `Gulp`_ and `Browserify`_. This way, we can easily "
"test our JavaScript libraries against jQuery/etc, and have the flexibility "
"of modularizing our code. See `JavaScript Bundles`_ for more information on "
"what and how we are bundling."

"To ease deployment and contributions, bundled JavaScript is checked into the "
"repository for now. This ensures new contributors don't need an additional "
"front end stack just for making changes to our Python code base. In the "
"future, this may change, so that assets are compiled before deployment, "
"however as our front end assets are in a state of flux, it's easier to keep "
"absolute sources checked in."
