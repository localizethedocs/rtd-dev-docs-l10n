"Currently, we access the API V2 from the builders using the credentials of "

"projects, write access to the API, access to restricted endpoints, and "
"restricted fields."

"The credentials are hardcoded in our settings file, so if there is a "

"Instead of using the credential of a super user to access the API, we will "

"a limited period of time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../design/secure-api-access-from-builders.rst:38
