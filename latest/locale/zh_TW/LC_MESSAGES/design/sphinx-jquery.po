msgid ""
"sphinxcontrib-jquery is a Sphinx extension that provides a simple mechanism "
"for other Sphinx extensions and themes to ensure that jQuery is included "
"into the HTML build outputs and loaded in the HTML DOM itself. More "
"specifically, the extension ensures that jQuery is loaded exactly once no "
"matter how many themes and extensions that request to include jQuery nor the "
"version of Sphinx."

"This extension assumes that it's enough to provide a single version of "
