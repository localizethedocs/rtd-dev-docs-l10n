msgstr ""

"Making strings in templates localizable is exceptionally easy. Making "

msgid ""
"A string is often a combination of a fixed string and something changing, "
"for example, ``Welcome, James`` is a combination of the fixed part ``Welcome,"
"``, and the changing part ``James``. The naive solution is to localize the "
"first part and then follow it with the name::"

"Sometimes, it can help localizers to describe where a string comes from, "
"particularly if it can be difficult to find in the interface, or is not very "
"self-descriptive (e.g. very short strings). If you immediately precede the "
"string with a comment that starts with ``Translators:``, the comment will be "
