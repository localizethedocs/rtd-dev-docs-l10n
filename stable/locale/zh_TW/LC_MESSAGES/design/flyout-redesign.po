"This document detailed an initial idea that was not implemented in the end. "
"Lot of things have changed since this document was written. A different "
"approach is being implemented as part of the work done on the new addons "

"This document describes the design of a new \"flyout API\" to replace our "
"existing `footer_html` endpoint in APIv2. The Read the Docs theme uses this "
"API to put an updated version selector with active versions into the lower "
"left menu. On other themes, this appears as a floating menu in the lower "
"right."

"The largest problem with the existing ``/api/v2/footer_html`` endpoint is "
"that it returns a blob of HTML. This limits the ability to use this data in "
"ways other than to generate our exact flyout. For example, Sphinx themes "
"other than our own cannot consume this data easily and there's no real "
"integration point for MkDocs at all."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../design/flyout-redesign.rst:40
msgid ""
"Due to how the URLs in the version selector are generated, this API endpoint "
"can be fairly expensive in the worst case for projects with many versions. "
"As it stands now, this API accounts for approximately 15% of the time taken "
"on our webservers at about 70ms for an average request (P95 ~= 150ms, P99 ~= "
"235ms)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../design/flyout-redesign.rst:44

"The current API is a combination of data about a project that contains "
"information on the live versions, translations, sub- and super-projects, and "
"links to various other things like downloads, the repository on the VCS, and "
"builds for the project on RTD itself. Some of this data never changes (links "
"to the project and builds on RTD itself) and are effectively static while "
"some of it could change after the documentation is built (translations, "
"active versions)."

"There is already significant overlap between the APIv2 ``footer_html`` call "
"with the existing APIv3 for a project (eg. ``https://app.readthedocs.org/api/"
"v3/projects/docs/``). The project API already returns much of the data we "
"want, but some things like other active versions, translations, and "
"downloads would require additional API calls or options. These options "
"already partially implemented via the `DRF Flex Fields <https://pypi.org/"
"project/drf-flex-fields/>`_ module (eg. ``https://app.readthedocs.org/api/v3/"
"projects/docs/?expand=active_versions``). Currently, there are separate API "
"endpoints for translations and downloads, but ideally all the data needed to "
"generate a version selector would be available from a single API."

"While this is a good approach, it will not be without issues. It's likely "
"that some database queries and especially URL generation will need to be "
"optimized for this to not perform worse than the existing footer API."

"about the project injected into the HTML of the generated documentation "
