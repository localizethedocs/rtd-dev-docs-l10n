"Here is a full list of labels that we use in the `GitHub issue tracker`_ and "

msgid ""
"Issues with this label are issues that the core team has accepted on to the "
"roadmap. The core team focuses on accepted bugs, features, and improvements "
"that are on our immediate roadmap and will give priority to these issues. "
"Pull requests could be delayed or closed if the pull request doesn't align "
"with our current roadmap. An issue or pull request that has not been "
"accepted should either eventually move to an accepted state, or should be "
"closed. As an issue is accepted, we will find room for it on our roadmap or "
"roadmap backlog."

msgid "*Bug*"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../issue-labels.rst:20
msgid ""
"An issue describing unexpected or malicious behaviour of the readthedocs.org "
"software. A Bug issue differs from an Improvement issue in that Bug issues "
"are given priority on our roadmap. On release, these issues generally only "
"warrant incrementing the patch level version."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../issue-labels.rst:25
msgid "*Design*"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../issue-labels.rst:26
msgid "Issues related to the UI of the readthedocs.org website."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../issue-labels.rst:28
msgid "*Feature*"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../issue-labels.rst:29
msgid ""
"Issues that describe new features. Issues that do not describe new features, "
"such as code cleanup or fixes that are not related to a bug, should probably "
"be given the Improvement label instead. On release, issues with the Feature "
"label warrant at least a minor version increase."

msgid "*Good First Issue*"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../issue-labels.rst:35

msgid "*Improvement*"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../issue-labels.rst:45
msgid ""
"An issue with this label is not a Bug nor a Feature. Code cleanup or small "
"changes to existing features would likely have this label. The distinction "
"for this label is that these issues have a lower priority on our roadmap "
"compared to issues labeled Bug, and aren't implementing new features, such "
"as a Feature issue might."
