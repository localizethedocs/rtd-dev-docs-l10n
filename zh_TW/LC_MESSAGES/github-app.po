"Our GitHub App integration consists of a GitHub App (one for each platform, "
"readthedocs.org and readthedocs.com), which can be installed on a user's "
"account or organization."

"After installing the GitHub App, users can grant access to all repositories "
"or select specific repositories, this allows Read the Docs to access the "
"repositories and perform actions on them, such as reporting build statuses, "
"and subscribe to events like push and pull request events."

"Unlike our other Git integrations, this doesn't rely on user's OAuth2 tokens "
"to interact with the repositories, instead it makes use of the installation. "
"As long as the installation is active and has access to the repositories, "
"Read the Docs can perform actions on them."

"Installations can be `suspended <https://docs.github.com/en/apps/maintaining-"
"github-apps/suspending-a-github-app-installation>`__, which means that the "
"GitHub App is still installed but cannot access any resources, this action "
"is reversible. Installations can also be uninstalled, which means that the "
"GitHub App is removed from the account or organization, and cannot access "
"any resources, this action is irreversible."

"Since we no longer make use of user's OAuth2 tokens, we need to keep track "
"of all the installations of our GitHub App in the database "
"(``GitHubAppInstallation`` model). Each remote repository has a foreign key "
"to the installation that has access to it, so we can use that installation "
"to perform actions on the repository."

"Once a GitHub app is installed, GitHub will send webhook events to our "
"application (``readthedocs.oauth.views``) related to the installation (even "
"when the installation is uninstalled or revoked), repositories, and "
"organizations. This allows us to always have the ``RemoteRepository`` and "
"``RemoteOrganization`` models and its permissions in sync with GitHub."

"The only use case for using the user's OAuth2 token is to get all the "

"Once we lose access to a repository (e.g. the installation is uninstalled or "
"revoked, or the project was deselected from the installation), we remove the "
"remote repository from the database, as we don't want to keep the relation "
"between the project and the repository. This is to prevent connecting the "
"repository to the project again without the user's consent if they grant "
"access to the repository again."
